# Python Program to calculate the square root


# Note: change this value for a different result
num5 = 8
# square root formula In this program, we store the number in num and find the square root using the ** exponent operator. This program works for all positive real numbers. But for negative or complex numbers, it can be done as follows.
num_sqrt = num5 ** 0.5
print(num_sqrt)



# To take the input from the user
#num = float(input('Enter a number: '))

num_sqrt = num5 ** 0.5
#%0.3f is %0.3f this is the older form of rounding
print('The square root of %0.3f is %0.3f'%(num5 ,num_sqrt))
#New way of rounding
print(round(num_sqrt,3))
