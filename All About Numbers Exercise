#Question 1
#What if it is not a perfect square, write a program that allows the user to input two sides
# and allows for it to be labeled a square or a rectangle using stored values.


if value == value: #sides equal
    #Then this happens
elif value != value: #sides do not equal
  #Then this happens
  
  
  
#Question 2
#After using stored values take an input from the user and repeat question 1.



Excersise 
#What if a user inputs a letter instead of an int?
#Add expection handling into your program
# I have given you a good starting point 

while True: #this loop happens over and over until data is a number value entered by the user.
    try:
        data=eval(input("Enter a Number: ")) #input must be a number or it prints Invalid input
        print ("You entered: ",data) #if input is a number then the program does this line
        break; # break is only executed if the input is numeric
    except NameError:
        print ("Invalid input")
