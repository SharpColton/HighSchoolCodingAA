# square root formula In this program, we store the number in num and find the square root using the ** exponent operator. This program works for all positive real numbers. But for negative or complex numbers, it can be done as follows.
num_sqrt = num5 ** 0.5
print(num_sqrt)



# To take the input from the user
#num = float(input('Enter a number: '))

num_sqrt = num5 ** 0.5
#%0.3f is %0.3f this is the older form of rounding
print('The square root of %0.3f is %0.3f'%(num5 ,num_sqrt))
#New way of rounding
print(round(num_sqrt,3))





#Complex Numbers

# Find square root of real or complex numbers
# Importing the complex math module
import cmath

num6 = 1+2j

# To take input from the user
#num = eval(input('Enter a number: '))

num_sqrt = cmath.sqrt(num6)
print('The square root of {0} is {1:0.3f}+{2:0.3f}j'.format(num6 ,num_sqrt.real,num_sqrt.imag))

#In this program, we use the sqrt() function in the cmath (complex math) module.

#Note: If we want to take complex number as input directly, like 3+4j, we have to use the eval() function instead of float().

#The eval() method can be used to convert complex numbers as input to the complex objects in Python. More Information on Complex Number can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/
